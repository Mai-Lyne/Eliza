    <h3>What is GeeGee ?</h3>
    <p>GeeGee is a chatbot specialized only in the field of video games.</p>
    <h3>How does it work ?</h3>
    <p>If you have a specific question about a video game you can ask GeeGee and it will answer it.</p>
    <h3>What are the features of the chatbot ?</h3>
    <p>GeeGee offers everything the user needs, such as game tips, information on a particular character, or solutions if you are stuck in a specific place.</p>
    <h3>Is the chatbot able to recommend video games based on user preferences ?</h3>
    <p>yes, as long as the user has subsequently specified their preferences.</p>
    <h3>How does the chatbot get its information about video games ?</h3>
    <p>GeeGee is linked to the OpenAI GPT-3 API. So all its information is in this API.</p>
    <h3>Can the chatbot understand questions asked in different dialects or languages ?</h3>
    <p>As a language model based on GPT-3, GeeGee can understand and produce text in many languages. It is able to understand and generate text in English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Russian and many other languages. However, it may not be fully proficient in all of these languages and their accuracy may vary depending on the complexity of the language and the quality of the input provided.</p>
    <h3>Can the chatbot help players find teammates or opponents to play online ?</h3>
    <p>No, GeeGee is unable to find game partners. GeeGee is a chatbot that only allows you to answer questions. However, it remains a good idea and we are not against this possibility.</p>
